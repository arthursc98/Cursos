    "Part 2: Speed It Up<br/>\n",
    "You found in the SVM mini-project that the parameter tune can significantly speed up the training time of a machine learning algorithm.  A general rule is that the parameters can tune the complexity of the algorithm, with more complex algorithms generally running more slowly.  <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to control the complexity of an algorithm is via the number of features that you use in training/testing.  The more features the algorithm has available, the more potential there is for a complex fit.  We will explore this in detail in the “Feature Selection” lesson, but you’ll get a sneak preview now.<br/><br/>\n",
